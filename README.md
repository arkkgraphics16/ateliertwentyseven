# Atelier 27

A modern, international restaurant experience built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui primitives, and Framer Motion.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Additional scripts:

- `pnpm build` – Create a production build
- `pnpm start` – Start the production server
- `pnpm lint` – Run ESLint
- `pnpm typecheck` – Run TypeScript type checks

Create an `.env.local` file based on `.env.local.example` before running locally.
